               in a simple and easy way;

Technologies:- tkinter for GUI;
             - pytube and os(for downloading and choosing the file extension);

#Implementation:

class Youtube_Downloader: def __init__(self):
                         -creates the window for the app, sets its color,
                           width and height
                         -adds labels for the user to insert the youtube
                           link, to select the file name, the file path, and the download
                           options;
                         -receives the user input from buttons/labels, finds the
                           chosen file-path and gets the youtube link;
                         -shows the thumbnail of the video, with Pillow, because Tkinter
                           does not support jpg files;
                        
                         def get_help:
                         -if the user clicks on the icon from to the top left corner,
                          a help window will pop up with a message presenting the instructions
                          of how to use the program;

                         def get_format:
                         -choose format MP4(low resolution with the help of .get_lowest_resolution
                          function or high resolution with get_highest_resolution function),
                          the user can also choose MP3 format;
                         -if the user did not choose a format it will pop up an error box;

                         def is_valid_link:
                         -checks if the download link is valid: if the thumbnail exist;

                         def get_link:
                         -checks the length of the link: if it's null(there is no input link)
                          an error box will pop up;
                         -if the user inserts a non-youtube link, will show an error message;
                         -if the user did not introduce a valid youtube link(the thumbnail does
                          not exist) an error message will pop up;
                         -gets the path where it will be downloaded and the name specified;

                         def run:
                         -the app flow;

                         def main:
                         -define app as Youtube_Downloader;
                         -runs the program.

If the user receives sound errors he should change from wav to MP3
